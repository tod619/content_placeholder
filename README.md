## Description

An example of adding an animation to a card class as the card waits for data to load in. In this example the data is hardcoded into the js file but the data could be pulled from a database or third party api. The animation plays for 2.5 seconds and as the data loads into the card elements the animated classes are removed from the card.

## Demo
